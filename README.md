I wanted to try creating my own NPM package, as I have been programming in node for years but never made one.

## Docs

Contains a function which returns my various usernames and socials. Example:

```js
const falsefox = require("falsefox") 

console.log(falsefox())
// { name: 'falsefox', github: 'false-fox', website: 'falsefox.dev' }
```
